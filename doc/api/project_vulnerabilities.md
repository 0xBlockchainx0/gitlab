# Project Vulnerabilities API **(ULTIMATE)**

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/10242) in [GitLab Ultimate](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) 12.6.

CAUTION: **Caution:**
This API is currently in development and is protected by a **disabled**
[feature flag](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/).
On a self-managed GitLab instance, an administrator can enable it by starting the Rails console
(`sudo gitlab-rails console`) and then running the following command: `Feature.enable(:first_class_vulnerabilities)`.
To test if the Vulnerabilities API was successfully enabled, run the following command:
`Feature.enabled?(:first_class_vulnerabilities)`.

CAUTION: **Caution:**
This API is in an alpha stage and considered unstable.
The response payload may be subject to change or breakage
across GitLab releases.

Every API call to vulnerabilities must be [authenticated](README.md#authentication).

Vulnerability permissions inherit permissions from their project. If a project is
private, and a user isn't a member of the project to which the vulnerability
belongs, requests to that project will return a `404 Not Found` status code.

## Vulnerabilities pagination

API results are paginated, and `GET` requests return 20 results at a time by default.

Read more on [pagination](README.md#pagination).

## List project vulnerabilities

List all of a project's vulnerabilities.

If an authenticated user does not have permission to
[use the Project Security Dashboard](../user/permissions_stub_first_class_vulnerabilities.md#project-members-permissions),
`GET` requests for vulnerabilities of this project will result in a `403` status code.

GET /projects/:id/vulnerabilities

## New vulnerability

Creates a new vulnerability.

If an authenticated user does not have a permission to
[create a new vulnerability](../user/permissions_stub_first_class_vulnerabilities.md#project-members-permissions),
this request will result in a `403` status code.

```plaintext
POST /projects/:id/vulnerabilities?finding_id=<your_finding_id>
```

| Attribute           | Type              | Required   | Description                                                                                                                  |

| `id`                | integer or string | yes        | The ID or [URL-encoded path of the project](README.md#namespaced-path-encoding) which the authenticated user is a member of  |
| `finding_id`        | integer or string | yes        | The ID of a Vulnerability Finding from which the new Vulnerability will be created   
                                         |

The other attributes of a newly created Vulnerability are populated from
its source Vulnerability Finding, or with these default values:

| Attribute    | Value                                                 |

| `state`      | `opened`                                              |
